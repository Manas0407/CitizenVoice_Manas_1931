           Bangladesh has so many problems in public service and   administration. Most of the local and central government offices are not in the reach of general peoples. So, the socioeconomic development is mostly not placed with the demand of the vast population. Though our country is developing its structures in a centralized point (may be the capital or other city areas), but some remote areas are still under the table. They feel lack of security, transportation, communication, health service, Information service, National Emergency service etc. Physically meeting with the respected authority is not easy in our country for a sustainable solution of the respected issue. So, I have decided to make an online based response system for the people of any stages. They can directly report about any issue to the respective authority. Then the authority will easily can take proper steps to ensure a sustainable solutions of the regarded problem. People also can access on “National Emergency Service-999” from this system.
